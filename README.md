# Image Classification
Three classic applications of image classification are explored to: 1) comprehend handwritten numbers using the MNIST dataset; 2) identifying species presence using camera-trap images from Snapshot Serengeti; and 3) diagnosing malaria using blood smear images. 


Contained in this repository are three folders, each of which correspond to the above listed projects.
