# Using neural networks to classify images
Three classic applications of image classification are explored to: 
1) comprehend handwritten numbers using the MNIST dataset; 
2) identifying species presence using camera-trap images from Snapshot Serengeti; and 
3) diagnosing malaria using blood smear images. 


Contained in this repository are three folders, each of which correspond to the above listed projects. Data for all three applications are open:
1) http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ for MNIST handwritten digits; 
2) https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5pt92 for Snapshot Serengeti camera-trap images; 
3) https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria for blood smear images
